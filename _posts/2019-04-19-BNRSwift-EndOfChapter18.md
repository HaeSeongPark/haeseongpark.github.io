## Summary
- Value vs. Reference Types
  - sematics of value and reference, constant value and reference types, Using value and reference types together(value in class, class in value) with immutable, shallow and deep copy, Identiy vs. Equality, What should I Use?(choosing between struct and class)

I think the contents in this chapter is not enough to know all about Value and Reference. So It would be good to read [the apple documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ClassesAndStructures.html) including links in it and [the advanced swift of objc.io](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/) including links in it.
