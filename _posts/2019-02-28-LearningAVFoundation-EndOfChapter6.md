## Summary
- detail AV Foundation capture APIs overall.
- make camera app similar to iPhone basic camera app. it's easy to follow step-by-step with stater project. But some code that is not related AV Foundation capture APIs like UI stuftt is already implemented and not comment or description. That's a shame. But It worths to read the code. It has ALAssetsLibrary code which is deprecated.
