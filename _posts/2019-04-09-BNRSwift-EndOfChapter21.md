## Summary
- Extension
I think it would be good to read the offical document instead of this chpater of this book.

Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. 

Extensions in Swift can:

Add computed instance properties and computed type properties
Define instance methods and type methods
Provide new initializers
Define subscripts
Define and use new nested types
Make an existing type conform to a protocol

Syntax? See the offical document [link](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Extensions.html)
